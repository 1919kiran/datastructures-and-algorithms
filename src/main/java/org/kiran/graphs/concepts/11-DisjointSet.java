/**
 * Purpose:
 * To efficiently keep track of elements that are split into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.
 * 
 * Usecases:
 * - Detecting connectivity: To check whether two elements are in the same group. For example, in a social network
 * - Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm: Union-Find is used where you need to check if adding an edge would create a cycle.
 * - Cycle detection in graphs: Efficient for checking if an undirected graph has a cycle.
 * - Dynamic connectivity problems: When you have a set of items and keep merging subsets, DSU lets you query relationships quickly.
 * 
 * Patterns:
 * - Connected Components in Undirected Graphs: Count components after unions; also used when edges get added dynamically.
 * - Cycle Detection in undirected graphs
 * - Connected Components in Grids
 * - Accounts Merge / String Grouping
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Let's keep a parent array for each node to keep track of who is the parent node of the node.
 * 2. Let's keep a rank array for each node to keep track of count of how many nodes are below it (not exactly depth/height)
 * 3. When doing union of (u,v):
 *  - if rank(u)!=rank(v), attach the root of smaller rank node to root of larger rank node
 *  - if rank(u)==rank(v) then make u parent of v and increase rank of u
 *  note: rank is not increased when a smaller rank node is attached to larger rank node becase rank != height, it indicates 
 *  which to pick at each step why not connect larger to smaller? because that will increase the path to be travlled to find a parent
 * 4. When doing find:
 *  - Recursively find the ultimate parent, and update the parent as this ultimate root for every node along the recursive path (backtracking). 
 *  This is called as path compression.
